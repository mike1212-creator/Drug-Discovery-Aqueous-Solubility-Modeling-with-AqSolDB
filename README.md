# Drug-Discovery-Aqueous-Solubility-Modeling-with-AqSolDB
In 'Drug Discovery: Aqueous Solubility Modeling with AqSolDB,' I employed machine learning to predict drug compound solubility. Using AqSolDB data, my work aids in identifying promising drug candidates by providing accurate solubility predictions, potentially expediting drug discovery timelines.
